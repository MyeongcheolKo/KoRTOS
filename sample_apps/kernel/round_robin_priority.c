round_robin_priority.c

Demonstrates the kernel's two scheduling policies at once:
  - PRIORITY based selection: the highest-priority READY task always runs.
  - ROUND-ROBIN: tasks of equal priority take turns, none starves.

Tasks:
  task1, priority 2, prints, then busy_spin()          -> CPU-bound, never blocks
  task2, priority 2, prints, then busy_spin()          -> CPU-bound, never blocks
  task3, priority 1, prints, then os_task_delay(1000)  -> highest priority, sleeps
  task4, priority 2, prints, then busy_spin()          -> CPU-bound, never blocks

Tasks 1/2/4 use busy_spin() (a plain CPU loop) instead of os_task_delay on
purpose: a delayed task becomes BLOCKED and leaves the ready set, which would
hide round-robin. Spinning keeps them READY so the scheduler must rotate between 
them. Task 3 uses os_task_delay to demonstrate that it preempts the other tasks 
when it wakes, proving priority.

Expected ITM/SWO output (repeats):
Task schedular initialized
This is task 3    <- highest priority runs first             [PRIORITY]
This is task 4    ->
This is task 1    ->  equal-priority tasks rotate, none starves [ROUND-ROBIN]
This is task 2    ->
This is task 3    <- task3 wakes from its delay and preempts [PRIORITY]
This is task 4
This is task 1
This is task 2
  ...

- task3 appearing first, and cutting back in every time it wakes, proves
priority: a priority 1 task always beats the priority 2 tasks when READY.
- task1, task2 AND task4 all appearing proves round-robin: three equal-
priority tasks all get the CPU, and task 4 is scheduled first then task 1 and task 2.

NOTE: printf is neither atomic nor reentrant, and the kernel is preemptive, so a
context switch can land in the middle of a printf. When it does, a second task's
output gets braided into the first's, and because the two calls share one global
(non-reentrant) printf buffer, some characters are also lost:

    task1 prints:  "This is task 1"
    task2 prints:  "This is task 2 "
    ITM may show:  "This is taskThis is ta 2 sk 2"   (interleaved + chars dropped)

This is a printf limitation, not a scheduler bug. Serialize printf (critical
section, mutex, or a single printer task) for clean output.
